# Aries Mobile SDK - Demo's

This document highlights various mobile apps that have been created using Aries Framework JavaScript and React Native. The point of highlighting these is to show that the Aries Framework JavaScript has the appropriate Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to start building the Aries Mobile SDK.

On the 27th of April 2021, the UNICC's Chief Technology Officer Shashank Rai announced plans to create a digital identity infrastructure for all United Nations employees. It aims to solve the data fragmentation problems and broken processes within the United Nations. An important component of that infrastructure is a mobile agent. To build this component, they chose Aries Framework JavaScript.

## [The Linux Foundation - Cardea](https:cardea.app)

Cardea is a fully open source, privacy-preserving ecosystem for digital health credentials initiated by Indicio.tech. The project was recently adopted by The Linux Foundation and an IATA poll concluded that 78% of the participants of the survey will only use a travel health app if they have full control over their data. As Indicio.tech is an active contributor to Aries Framework JavaScript, Cardea is fully based on Aries Framework JavaScript and is one of the first production grade mobile applications built atop the framework.

## [Animo Mobile Agent PoC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e15BUHvOOhs)
Animo Solutions created a React Native proof-of-concept application to demonstrate that Aries Framework JavaScript can run in a React Native environment. The application is capable of creating connections, receiving credentials and presenting proofs. Animo has recorded a short demo that shows this functionality.
